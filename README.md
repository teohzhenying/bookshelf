The purpose of this code is to create three similar web page designs using different CSS frameworks (normal CSS, Bootstrap and Foundation), render them (my computer specifications are MacBookAir, Sonoma 14.5, Safari) and find out which web page uses the most CPU energy.

The results are as shown:

main (normal CSS) uses average CPU of 1.7% and renders in a duration of 5s, foundation is the fastest but also uses the most energy at 3.6% and bootstrap uses the least energy at 1.4% in 5s. Note that the images for foundation and bootstrap are slightly bigger than main.

When rendered, there are 4 pictures in one line for both foundation and bootstrap. They just resize differently if you click on element console.

Disclaimer for educational purposes: I had ChatGPT's help in checking my grid code so that my images will align properly.
